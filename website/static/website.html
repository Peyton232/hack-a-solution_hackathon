        <h1 class = "titles">Problem</h1>
        <p>Payment terminals in stores are a breeding ground for cross contamination and are not an ideal way to pay in person. Especially with the recent outbreak of covid-19 this can be a real
          problem to the general public and also make people avoid going to stores. And with small scale sellers lots of the time they are locked into a cash only option which would be even worse
          for cross contamination.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <h1 class = "titles">Purpose</h1>
        <p>Every hour dozens of customers could be touching a payment terminal in a store this could lead to much cross contamination that is really unnecessary. We wanted to eliminate this
          “bottleneck” and to keep customers safer when shopping. We have come up with QR Pay, a form of payment that is completely contactless, and works similarly to how you would buy items
          online.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <h1 class = "titles">Solution</h1>
        <p>We have come up with an app that lets a seller create a ticket and generate a unique QR code for a customer to scan and pay without making physical contact with anything.
           This also gives an option to small scale sellers to have access to an easy form of contactless payment.</p>

  <h2 class = "titles">How it Works</h2>
  <p>qr Pay works by ...</p>
    <ol class="gradient-list" >
    <li>The seller creates a new order</li>
    <li>The seller fills out the information on the QR pay mobile app</li>
    <li>The seller generates a unique qr code for the order</li>
    <li>The buyer scans this qr code</li>
    <li>The buyer is brought to a payment page where they get a summary of the order and can fill out payment info</li>
    <li>Once all info is filled out you press the pay button</li>
    <li>Transaction complete</li>
  </ol>
